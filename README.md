# rguthrieClickyGame
Clicky Game! Score points by not clicking the same image twice! React-with-hooks app.

Uses React with hooks (useState, useEffect).

Clicky Game offers a choice of grid size for a set of cards with GIF images.
The user scores points by clicking cards which haven't been clicked before...
but the cards are shuffled after each click. Clicking all of the cards 
uniquely is rewarded with a special 'sparkle' background.

This React app was created using the react package's create-react-app
script for the npm CLI.  

The app is deployed on GitHub pages at:

https://rguthrie000.github.io/rguthrieClickyGame/

# Design Notes

File App.js is the state and HTML body file. Custom React components for the head section
(ClickyHead) and the game body (ClickyBody) are used within the HTML body in App.

Data flows down to the components using the 'conventional' props process.  

App.js uses The create-react-app script supplied with the react package was used to create the startup and initial HTML file.
A bootstrap.com link was added to the index.HTML file, and the utils/API file was created,
but otherwise only the files in /src are application-specific.

## This application was developed with:
VS Code - Smart Editor for HTML/CSS/JS
node.js - JavaScript command-line interpreter
Google Chrome Inspector - inspection/analysis tools integrated in Chrome Browser.
react - middleware for optimized DOM manipulation and integrated JSX coding.
github - version control, content repository.
